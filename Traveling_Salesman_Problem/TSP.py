Travelling Salesman Problem
A salesman must visit 6 cities: A, B, C, D, E, F.
The distances (in kilometers) between the cities are given below:

From / To   A   B   C   D   E   F
A           0  10  15  20  25  30
B          10   0  35  25  17  28
C          15  35   0  30  28  40
D          20  25  30   0  22  16
E          25  17  28  22   0  35
F          30  28  40  16  35   0

Task:
The salesman must:
1. Start from City A.
2. Visit each city exactly once.
3. Return to City A.

ðŸ‘‰ Question: What is the shortest possible route the salesman can take, and what is the total
distance?
